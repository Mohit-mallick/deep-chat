# Introduction

Deep Chat is a fully customizable chat component that can be injected into any website with minimal amount of effort required.

No two chat components will ever be the same. We understand that your APIs have unique requirements and your websites demand novel UX. This is why Deep Chat is built to be fully customizable; from interactive features to minute styling details - everything can be changed to build the component you need.

Developer experience is paramount to this component's success! This is why Deep Chat is shipped in a cross-framework plug-and-play package to allow you to get started in just a few seconds no matter what platform you use! Additionally, we carefully monitor all of your feedback to help us optimise your and your users' chat experience as well as use it as a base point for helping us decide what future improvements the component will need.
